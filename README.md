# SortTest – Java Program for Sorting Large Data Sets

This project contains a Java program that reads a large dataset of integers from a text file and sorts them using the Bubble Sort algorithm. It also measures the time taken to read and sort the data.

## Description

- The program reads integers from a file named `20Mints.txt`.
- It stores the integers in an array.
- The program then sorts the array using a basic **Bubble Sort** algorithm.
- It times both the reading and sorting operations and checks if the array is sorted correctly.

## Files

- `SortTest.java` – Main Java program.
- `20Mints.txt` – A text file containing a large set of integers (should be in the same directory as the Java file).

## How to Compile and Run

You can run this on your local machine using a Java compiler. Make sure Java is installed.

### 1. Compile the Java file:

```bash
javac SortTest.java
